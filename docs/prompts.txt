MCP Server:

Create an MCP server for an Azure Agentic Weather App. The MCP server must:
- Be implemented as an independent microservice
- Expose REST endpoints that abstract the Weatherstack API
- Validate incoming parameters.
- Handle external API communication.
- Return normalized JSON responses.
- Prevent direct exposure of the Weatherstack API key.
- Have exactly one MCP tool to get the current weather.
- All file(s) must be in a folder named "mcp-server"

Ask me questions to clarify the product requirements, technical requirements, engineering principles, and hard constraints.

I later gave it context that I was using Azure AI Projects for the LLM and told it to create requirements.txt and .env.example in the root directory.
I told it to have the unit be in Fahrenheit and the language to be English. Also asked it to create unit tests.
Found bug where Weatherstack free tier doesn't allow HTTPS requests and fixed.
